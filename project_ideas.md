## Project ideas 

In general, we encourage students to conceive and work on their own projects. However, inspiration can be a fickle misstress so we provide some project ideas just in case.

### Project 1: Reading out long term memory  

#### Background
Flies can learn to associate odors with reward or punishment. Memories are formed & stored in the mushroom body: this structure is common to all insects and consists of parallel axonal fibers from Kenyon Cells (KCs) which target Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONS).
Broadly speaking, most MBONs encode for either approach or avoidance. Dopaminergic neurons function as reward/punishment coincidence detector they modulate the synaptic strength between KCs and MBONs.
When such short-term memory transitions into long-term storage we expect to see actual anatomical changes, i.e. more or less synapses between KCs and a given MBON.

#### Question 
Given that there is in theory an anatomical correlate for long-term memories, we should be able to read out a fly's memory trace by modelling its mushroom body and apply fictive olfactory stimuli. 

In particular, we propose to compare the mushroom bodies of two flies: based on the FAFB/FlyWire and the hemibrain datasets.
