# Spiking Network Model of an entire Fly Brain
Instructors: Dr. Philipp Schlegel & Dr. Andrew Champion (University of Cambridge, UK)

This repository contains resources and data for the Spiking Network project.

## Description
The central brain of the fruit fly contains approximately 33k neurons - a staggering number if one was to investigate them experimentally in the wet lab. One way to scale analysis to whole-brain level is to model neuronal activity in-silico. In this project we will use the recently published FlyWire resource to implement a spiking model of the entire fly brain using the NEURON simulator. You will learn to generate and test hypotheses about brain function on this model. After an initial introduction into the basics of connectomics datasets and the NEURON simulator where we will focus on the flyâ€™s olfactory system, students will be developing and exploring their own research questions and models for their final project. A working knowledge of Python is recommended.

## Tools, Techniques & Concepts
- Python programming
- Querying connectomic datasets 
- Generating spiking neural networks using NEURON
- Visualisation and statistical analysis of the data
